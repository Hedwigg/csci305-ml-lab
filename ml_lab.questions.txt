=======================
1. val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list

2. Function 'f' increments each element in a list by 1. If the list has no elements,
	it doesn't do anything.

3. The line before "a" defines a function 'f' that takes a list[] as a parameter and returns either an empty list using the pattern []
 	(if the input list was empty) or (line b).

4. The line before "b" states that for every element in the non-empty list that was passed into f, add 1 to it. It uses the cons operator :: to use a cons of
		patterns as a pattern, to extract each element and to add the incremented element back to the rest of the list.

11. Something I like about ML is how functions can be so much more detailed by the use of patterns. My favorite pattern is the cons of patterns as a pattern.
	Ex. Using (x::xs) to manipulate elements in lists.

12.	What I dislike most about ML is its readability to those who are not super experienced in the language. The shorthand and uncommon syntax still throws me though
	 a loop sometimes. Especially when I am reading new or unfamiliar code. It takes me a considerable amount more time to understand basic code in ML than if it
	 was written in another language.
